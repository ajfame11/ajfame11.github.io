This is the first self project I have done. It took allot of planning on figuring out what I even wanted to do. I was nervous and clumsly with deciding what to base the project on. I tried to go about with trying to use an API but that wasn't going the way I wanted it to at first. I kept over exaggerating and making the project more difficult than it should have been in the beginning. I decided to do web scraping and take one step at a time with building out my project. Starting with my scraper file to my objects file and finally to my cli file. It was pretty difficult for me. As I started my mnd went blank and I needed to go back over allot of information pertaining to my project. Starting with my scraper file, I had multiple gems installed to begin scraping and a sracper tool provided to practice scraping results. Fortunately, I learned how to access another website from the primary website that I was scraping so that I can scrape additional information from the secondary website. After getting and setting each piece of information, I set them through my objects file to be turned into objects that can be returned to the user. The Cli file of my project was the second most difficult to work throughout my project. I made sure to use boolean operators and more to shorten my code as much as I can to better work through and understand. All in all I learned first hand the importance of roles each method/class has to play in relation to the entire project. The importance of spelling was great, there were many times I had to double check my grammer. It was an experience going through the stress of building this project. I had to choose where to start the project and after doing that, I simplified my project, from there it became easy to figure out the questions I needed to ask in order to finish my project.
