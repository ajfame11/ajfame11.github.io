With my prject, it took me a week of planning what to do and how to do it before starting. The process was quite difficult as I was in the mindset of creating a very unique project and was worried over having same as others, when in reality practically every idea I had was already thought of and done. Realizing this, I had fallen into the same mistake I had previously of having a bit of tunnel vision and over thinking my poject and decided to simplified it to an application that works and passes requirements. I began the process of planning my JavaScript Project with  writing out my models and their relationships, controllers with the actions I thought I would need, routes and fetch requests I thought of making, and an app flow description. The process was lead to creating a game, which I then further picked Tic-Tac-Toe. 


I had a tough time with understanding how the backend relationship between Users and Games worked to the frontend portion of my project. and viceversa. I had to build the game with a constructor to better work out the application and User to Game connection. To do that i decided to use a class.


In JavaScript, the concept of a class doesn't exist like it does in Ruby. Instead we have JavaScript objects. JavaScript objects consist of a constructor and a prototype. A constructor  is a function that will be built upon with additional functionality (through prototypes). Functions, by default, get a prototype property. It is always an empty hash. A prototype property is empty when a Javascript object is initialized, and you can add properties to the prototype. The only thing that makes a constructor a constructor function is the fact that the function's name is capitalized. This is a convention for constructors in JavaScript.


From there came the roundabout difficulties of creating the reset function for the game as well as score saving capabilities. It was helpful using an API for testing purposes but difficult with writing out the different functions that the game required to work correctly. I had thought of an player vs computer feature but decided best as an long term goal rather than a short term goal. All in all this project was challenging and difficult to overcome due to my narrow mind and over thinking ways. It is best to follow plans and create short term goals where the application the bare minimum thats needed to work and then work on furthering it slowly to the point that you yourself are comfortable with.
