For me, what is the important thing to understand about Variables an Methods is by following the 5 W's. Who, what, when, where, and why.  The most important thing to understand is what they are. Variables are words or characters that hold values, variables allow us to store information. Methods tell your Ruby program to do a routine or behavior that it can do. One phrase that I like and understand the most is that Variables are like nouns and methods are like verbs.
