There are many reasons as to why I choose to study software engineering, but the most personal one would be when it started out as an interest but turned into a hobby. I was young at the time, probably 6 or 7, when I recieved my first electronic device which was a Gameboy Advance. Being a young boy, I was so happy to have one. It felt so good learning how to use and play with it. After awhile I started to get curious about it, like why does it work the way it does? What makes it able for people to play games on it? I looked online and found old videos that showed step by step instructions on how to take apart a Gameboy and optimize it for a brighter screen display and hopefully a more efficient gameplay experience. It was fun and challenging to work on my Gameboy Advance, kinda like a puzzle that I got absorbed into solving. It soon turned from an interest to a hobby, then from a hobby to a passion. Growing up in my household, it was drilled into my head that the medical field is where the money and a succesful happy life is at. I understand that it is a rewarding career field but may not be for me was how I felt. So I switched on over to learn how to better use computers and then learned to dabbled in coding. Now I want to further my coding education in order to make a career out of the technology field, one that I would be happy and proud of.
