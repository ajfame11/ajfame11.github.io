You would think you would be better prepared for future projects and be armed with knowlegde and resources, but wow, I have to say this project was as difficult and tedious as the first. Not too much because of lack of knowlegde or anything but because of one can never fully be prepared for everything. It was grueling getting errors at every corner due to mispelling or of not knowing how to properly code this line. I was planning on going over the top with this project but when trying to did I realize I needed to know allot more than I currently did. I didn't want to rely so much on my cohort lead and try hard to search the answers to my questions but even that was difficult to for some reason I still don't know about. In the end though I did decide that I need to take baby steps towards coding and push hard when I can. It was a challenge to try to go beyond what the project initially was but I left notes of what I wanted to improve on later in the future. What I like about coding is that you can keep learning and trying as long as you are motivated to go through errors and difficulties. My project is a basic idea space for game creations. I had difficulties here and there with setting it up. There is more that I wish to do to it later on in the future for personal practice. I tried to incorporate CSS here and there to improve looks but that was a hassle with colors clashing, so I would say my designing skills need improvement. But all in all my simple sinatra project works and I cann say that there is room for improvement that I want to personally make.
